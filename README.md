# Is this related to DSX?
 - No, it's a free alternative for those who need it and a hobby project.

# How do I activate UDP?
 - All you need to do is run a game with dualsense mod installed, it will turn to active as soon as it receives data (If the mod asks for a port, use 6969)

# Problems:
 - I get a pop-up that says ViGEmBus is not installed! -> https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases/download/v1.22.0/ViGEmBus_1.22.0_x64_x86_arm64.exe
 - Controller emulation is wonky? Install .NET 8.0 -> https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x86&rid=win-x86&os=win10&apphost_version=8.0.6
 - Double input in-game? Install HidHide driver and run app as admin -> https://github.com/nefarius/HidHide/releases/download/v1.5.230.0/HidHide_1.5.230_x64.exe
 - The app renders a black screen on my laptop! -> Run the application with your dedicated GPU instead of iGPU
